# **Yahtzee!**

A dice game invented by an anonymous Canadian couple to play aboard their yacht but now adapted so that you can play it wherever!

### How the game works:

On your turn, you have three opportunities to roll the dice to score the highest points from funky dice combinations (more info on these combinations in the game UI). After three rolls, mark your score or a zero on your scorecard in the corresponding column. You may stop after the first roll if satisfied with the outcome. The game continues until all 13 score categories have been filled.

### Motivation/Insipration:

Yahtzee has always been one of those games my family throws onto the table when we have a gathering and it's a blast every time. Besides the game being just genuinely enjoyable to play and see those scores add up at the end of the game, I thought it would be a good test of my current programming skills to see if I can properly implement all of the funky scoring combinations and rules Yahtzee has to offer!
